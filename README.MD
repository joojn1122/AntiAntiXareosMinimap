# Anti Anti Xaero's Minimap

> Prevent servers from disabling your Xaero's Minimap.

## Description

Some Minecraft servers attempt to disable Xaero's Minimap by sending special packets or messages to the client.  
This mod prevents that — allowing you to continue using Xaero's Minimap even on servers that try to block it.

## Features

- Blocks server attempts to disable Xaero's Minimap
- Stops specific packets or system messages targeting the minimap
- Lightweight & fully client-side
- Compatible with Fabric 1.21.4+

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](#)
2. Drop the `.jar` file into your Minecraft `mods` folder
3. Make sure you have:
    - Fabric Loader installed
    - Xaero's Minimap installed

## Notes

- This mod does not bypass bans or restrictions unrelated to the minimap itself.
- This mod is purely defensive — it only prevents forced minimap disabling.
- Always respect server rules.
